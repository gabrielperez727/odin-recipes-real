    <ol>
      <li>
        Trim the steak and cut them into small cubes, the size of ½ cm (⅕ ").
        Set them aside. You can cut the steak larger but the cooking time would
        be longer. Finely chop the lamb fat and set it aside (if using).
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the onion salad: finely slice the onions and mix with chopped
        parsley salt and sumac in a medium-sized bowl. You can also add pul
        biber (flaked chili). Set it aside until you are ready to build the
        wraps.Prepare the onion salad: finely slice the onions and mix with

        wraps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice or dice the tomatoes, and set them aside along with the onion
        salad.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place your wok or large skillet on medium heat and then add the lamb fat
        (if using) to render it. If not using lamb fat, add olive oil or butter
        to the wok and heat it before adding the beef
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the beef until it releases its water and absorbs it back, for about
        10 minutes. Add the salt, black pepper, and paprika, and sauté the beef
        for another minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the water and cook for another 10 minutes until half of the
        liquid evaporates.
      </li>
      <li>
        To build your wraps, place a piece of lavash or wheat tortilla wrap on
        top of the meat to absorb the gravy. Leave the lavash for 20 seconds
        until it is soaked with gravy and place it on a plate, the clean side is
        down.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top the lavash with chopped tomato, onion salad, and two tablespoons of
        beef.
      </li>
      <li>Tightly wrap it, securing both sides to keep the filling in.</li>
      <li>
        Repeat the same with the remaining wraps and meat. Cut them in halves
        and then serve immediately with extra onion salad, chopped tomatoes, and
        pickled baby chilies on the side.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
