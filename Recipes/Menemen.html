    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      This hearty egg scramble gets its name from the Turkish market town of
      Menemen, a small town located just off the main highway of north Izmir.
      Menemen is basically scrambled eggs with tomatoes, peppers and, sometimes,
      onions. The seasoning is quite simple and often includes a dash of dried
      herbs (I used oregano) and a touch of heat from some chili flakes. I used
      a combination of Aleppo-style pepper, which adds depth and a subtle
      sweetness, and a dash of hot red pepper flakes for some heat.

      <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>

    <h2>How to make Menemen:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a 10-inch skillet, heat 2 tablespoons over medium heat. Add the
        onions and peppers and season with kosher salt. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes,
        stirring regularly until softened (being careful not to brown the
        onions).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tomatoes and tomato paste. Season with a little more kosher
        salt, black pepper, oregano, and Aleppo pepper. Cook for a few minutes
        over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes soften but
        still hold their shape (5 to 7 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Push the tomato and pepper mixture to one side of the pan. Lower the
        heat to medium-low. Add the beaten egg, and cook briefly, stirring
        gently as needed, until the eggs are just set. Fold the tomato mixture
        into the eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finish with a little EVOO and more Aleppo pepper and crushed red pepper
        flakes, if you need a little kick. Serve immediately with thick slices
        of bread.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
