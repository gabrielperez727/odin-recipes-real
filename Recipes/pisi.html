    <h1>PIŞI</h1>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      A pişi is a fluffy ball of fried bread served with breakfast in Turkey. If
      you think there is nothing more comforting than warm soft bread, then they
      are perfect for you. Pişi is the star of any Turkish breakfast spread!
      They are served to accompany cheese, slices of cucumber & tomatoes,
      olives, eggs, cold cuts, and a number of flavorful pastes & dips. Pişis
      are delicious and so indulgent, I’m sure they’ll soon become a staple of
      your brunch too!

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>375g all-purpose flour (2 ⅔ cup)</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>5g instant yeast (1 ½ tsp)</li>
      <li>185ml whole milk (¾ cup)</li>
      <li>frying oil (I used peanut oil)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make Pişi:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the dough. Place the flour in a large mixing bowl. Add the salt to
        one side and the yeast to the other. Gently heat the milk on the stove
        over medium heat until lukewarm. It shouldn’t be hotter than 43°C
        (110°F). Make a well in the flour and add the milk. Turn the mixture
        around with your fingers to pick up the ingredients from the side of the
        bowl. If you can’t gather all the flour, add a little bit of milk (1
        tbsp at a time) and mix gently again until you form a dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead the dough. Coat the work surface with a little bit of oil and tip
        the dough onto it. Knead for 10 min until you have a smooth ball of
        dough. You can add more oil to the work surface if the dough sticks too
        much while kneading. Place the dough in a large lightly oiled bowl and
        cover with oiled plastic wrap. Place the bowl in a warm spot. I like to
        heat the oven to 50°C (120°F) for a couple of minutes before turning the
        oven off and placing the bowl in there. Leave the dough to rise for 1h,
        or until doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the pişi. Line a baking tray with baking parchment and lightly
        flour it (or use a clean working surface). Divide the dough into 6 equal
        pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a tight ball. With your finger,
        make an indentation in the center of each ball but don’t go pierce all
        the way through. Place them slightly apart on the prepared tray. Loosely
        cover the balls with a damp tea towel and leave to prove for a further
        30 min. They only need to puff up a bit, not double in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry! Line a plate with 2 layers of paper towels. Fill a pan no more than
        ⅓ full with the oil. Heat the oil over medium-high heat to 180°C
        (355°F). Fry batches of 2 to 3 pişi at a time for 5 min (turn them
        halfway through cooking). Carefully remove pişis from the pan using a
        slotted spoon, drain on the paper towels and serve immediately.
